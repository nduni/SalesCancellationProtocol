 The sales cancellation protocol is required in trade companies. For accounting purposes, any return of goods, exchange or complaint should be included in such a protocol. Handwriting takes a long time. In addition, problems such as erroneous calculations or badly-written product names or measurand units appear. These errors are minor, but not acceptable by accounting. If there are dozens of protocols in a month and you need to double a few, then it may take a whole day.
 The main task of the application will be to shorten this time.
